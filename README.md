# CompPhysFWK

"CompPhysFWK" framework designed for students attending post-graduate course "Computational Physics". The frameworks allows to execute computational experiments using a chain of popular numerical methods. Additionally, the framework encourages its users to develop their own solutions.


Note: The number of dependencies for this project has grown. Look at the [buckaroo's](https://buckaroo.readthedocs.io/en/latest) solution, it may help at least for Windows.
